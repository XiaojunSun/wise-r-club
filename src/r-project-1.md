## Quiz

Explain the difference between `lapply`, `sapply`, `vapply`, `mapply`, `rapply`, and `apply`.

## Project

`air-quality.RData` includes the air-pollution data of all major cities in China from 2000 to 2013. Answer the following questions:

1. Decompose the pollution series of Beijing into trend, seasonal, and random noise components. Does its air pollution go worse all the time?
2. Which province has the worst air pollution? Which has the best air quality? (Build your own standard and use data to support your argument)
3. Decompose the time series for each city into stochastic trend, seasonal, and random noise components. From the trend data, what is the ratio of cities enjoying better air qualities than 10 years ago? What about those suffering from worse air quality than 10 years ago?
4. Is the stochastic trend of the air pollution predictable? (Use data and model to support your argument)
5. Are there any city whose stochastic trend of air pollution is comoving with that of Beijing? (hint: use cointegration tests to find out)
